# Post-Genres
The code for the tracery bot [@PostGenres](https://twitter.com/PostGenres). It uses [cheapbotsdonequick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) with the [Tracery](http://tracery.io/editor) language. 

If you are updating it, remember to add spaces after prefixes and before suffixes where needed. Genres should be space-free. Remember to have fun.
